    "Answer: <br> After calculating probability of admission for students with the same GPA and GRE (GRE of 800 and a GPA of 4) we found out that if he/she come from a tier-1, tier-2, tier-3, or tier-4 undergraduate school, the probability of getting admitted is increasing. The results are very close in both models. This shows that our hypothesis was correct. Students who attended a more prestigious undergraduate institution are more likely to be admitted to a graduate school. \n",

    "<br>I think, it would be interesting to collect/anayze more data that can influence student admission in general. I believe, there can be other important factors except for gpa, gre and prestige. Also, it'd be interesting to break schools by location and see how admission rate changes.\n"
